MKCPIO is a lua script processor for preparing initmarfs cpio files.

Primitives:

   set_output(file):

	Send output to this open lua file. If the argument is absent,
	the output is flushed, and the output is set to stdout.

   emit_directory(name, mode*, uid, gid)

   emit_file(names*, source, mode, uid, gid, is_block, major, minor)

   emit_node(names*, mode*, uid, gid 

   emit_pipe(names*, mode*, uid, gid)

   emit_socket(names*, mode*, uid, gid)

   emit_symlink(names**, target, mode, uig, gid)

* Names may be a single string or a table of strings for the hard
links to this data.  Source is the location of the file to copy
into the archive.

** Names may be a single string or a table of strings for the symbolic
links to this data.  Target is the location of the file to which to link.

* Modes and be integers or integer equivalent strings.  These are
processed via strtol, so to give an octal string, use a string of
digits with a leading zero.
